Identify areas where the code can be made more efficient, faster, or less resource-intensive. Provide specific suggestions for optimization, along with explanations of how these changes can enhance the code's performance. The optimized code should maintain the same functionality as the original code while demonstrating improved efficiency.", "output": "\nPythondef fibonacci(n):\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for _ in range(n):\n        yield a\n        a, b = b, a + b\n\nExplanation: Using a generator function with yield is more memory-efficient for generating the Fibonacci sequence. It avoids creating and storing the entire sequence in a list. Instead, it generates each number on-the-fly as needed.\n"}
