{"title": "Git gud", "user": "I have made some changes to my local files and I want to save them in my local Git repository. What Git command should I use?", "system": "", "output": "\nTo save the changes you've made to your local files in your local Git repository, you should use the following Git commands:\n\n\ngit add . or git add <file>\n\nThis command stages the changes you've made, preparing them to be committed. The . adds all changes in the current directory and its subdirectories. If you only want to stage specific files, replace . with the file name or path.\n\n\n\ngit commit -m \"Your commit message\"\n\nThis command commits the staged changes to your local Git repository. The -m flag allows you to provide a commit message describing the changes you've made. Replace \"Your commit message\" with a brief, descriptive summary of your changes.\n\n\n\nFor example, if you've made changes to a file named example.txt, you would run:\nShellgit add example.txt\ngit commit -m \"Update example.txt with new content\"\n\nThese commands will save your changes in your local Git repository, creating a new commit with the provided message. You can later push these changes to a remote repository or continue working on your local branch.\nRemember to run these commands from within your Git repository directory in your terminal or command prompt.\n"}
