Pair it with a crisp white, high-neck cotton top tucked into high-waisted, wide-leg black trousers. Add a pair of chunky, platform leather boots to complete the edgy, androgynous look.\n\n\nDenim and silk combo:\nOpt for a pair of black, oversized denim jeans with frayed hems and distressed details. Tuck in a deep red, silk button-down shirt with a draped, exaggerated collar or bow. Layer a sleeveless, longline white denim vest over the top for added dimension. Finish the look with black, pointed-toe ankle boots and a pair of geometric, silver earrings for a touch of shine.\n\n\nAvant-garde layering:\nStart with a form-fitting, black turtleneck bodysuit as a base layer. Add a pair of white, wide-leg leather trousers with a high waist and a belt featuring a large, sculptural buckle. Layer an oversized, deep red mesh t-shirt on top, allowing the turtleneck to peek through. Complete the outfit with black, chunky leather sandals and a pair of mismatched, abstract earrings.\n\n\nTips for styling and mixing textures:\n\nExperiment with layering different materials, such as leather, denim, cotton, and silk, to create visual interest and depth in your outfits.\nPlay with proportions by pairing oversized pieces with more fitted items to balance the overall silhouette.\nDon't be afraid to mix patterns or textures within the same color palette to add a bold, avant-garde touch to your look.\nAccessorize with statement pieces that complement the edgy, fearless vibe, such as chunky boots, geometric jewelry, or a sleek, minimalist clutch.\n\nRemember, avant-garde fashion is about pushing boundaries and experimenting with unconventional styles. Embrace your unique taste and have fun creating striking, memorable looks that showcase your personal style.\n"}
